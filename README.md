# Myrmex

[Play!]() (coming soon!)

## About

This is a JavaScript implementation of Myrmex, a solitaire game for the Decktet card system.  The Decktet was created by P.D. Magnus and released under a CC license.  Myrmex was created by Greg James.

The JavaScript implementation is partly based on an implementation of Adaman by Felbrigg Herriot, who released it under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike 3.0 License.

## Why?

Myrmex is a Decktet version of Spider, which I wanted to be able to play even when there isn't room to spread out my double Decktet deck.
