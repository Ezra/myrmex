The Decktet was created by P.D. Magnus and released under a CC license.  Myrmex was created by Greg James.\r\n\r\nThe JavaScript implementation is partly based on an implementation of Adaman by Felbrigg Herriot, who released it under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike 3.0 License.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nMyrmex is a Decktet version of Spider, which I wanted to be able to play even when there isn't room to spread out my double Decktet deck.\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n\r\nIn certain situations, a legal move will appear to fail.  It is actually being undone for unknown reasons.  \r\nWorkaround:  you can un-undo it using the Undo button.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [Decktet](http://decktet.com)\r\n* [Myrmex at the Decktet Wiki](http://decktet.wikidot.com/game:myrmex)\r\n* [Myrmex at BGG](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105292/myrmex)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
