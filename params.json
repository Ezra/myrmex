{"name":"Myrmex","tagline":"JavaScript implementation of the Spider-like Decktet solitaire game","body":"# Myrmex\r\n\r\n[Play!](http://mcdemarco.github.io/myrmex/myrmex.html)\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nThis is a JavaScript implementation of Myrmex, a solitaire game for the Decktet card system.  The Decktet was created by P.D. Magnus and released under a CC license.  Myrmex was created by Greg James; all of his variants are supported.\r\n\r\nThe JavaScript implementation is partly based on an implementation of Adaman by Felbrigg Herriot, who released it under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike 3.0 License.  Myrmex can be played in any browser (desktop or mobile), and will work offline.  A game can also be saved for later.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nMyrmex is a Decktet version of Spider, which I wanted to be able to play even when there isn't room to spread out my double Decktet deck.\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n\r\nIn certain situations, a legal move will appear to fail.  (It is actually being undone, probably due to a bug in one of the drag-and-drop libraries used.)\r\nWorkaround:  you can un-undo it using the Undo button.\r\n\r\nUndo only undoes one move; undoing again will re-do.  Undo will not undo a deal.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [Decktet](http://decktet.com)\r\n* [Myrmex at the Decktet Wiki](http://decktet.wikidot.com/game:myrmex)\r\n* [Myrmex at BGG](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105292/myrmex)\r\n* My implementation of [Adaman](https://mcdemarco.github.io/adaman/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
